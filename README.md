# Advent of code - *2020*
Solved tasks advent of code 2020

Maybe will help this link for an elegant solutions [here](https://1loc.dev/) 

## 1st day
I was given the task of finding the correct sum of 2 numbers in the array.

Numbers were just strings, so I converted them to an array and parsed them into a float type.

Next, I created a loop in a loop and gradually added all possible pairs. 

I compared the result with the value of 2020, which was determined in the assignment. 

After returning both values, I multiplied these values and submitted the result.

#### used components 
* split() - because of given input
1. 2 for loops and condition
2. 3 for loops and condition

## 2nd day

used functions 
* split()
* replace()
* new RegExp(value, 'g')
* match()
* charAt()

Solutions will be added asap. I will gradually add the first solution and the refactored solution.
