# Advent of code - *2020*
Solved tasks advent of code 2020

## 1 day
I was given the task of finding the correct sum of 2 numbers in the array.

Numbers were just strings, so I converted them to an array and parsed them into a float type.

Next, I created a cycle in a cycle and gradually added all possible pairs. 

I compared the result with the value of 2020, which was determined in the assignment. 

After returning both values, I multiplied these values and submitted the result.
