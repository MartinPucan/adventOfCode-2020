I was given the task of finding the correct sum of 2 numbers in the array.

Numbers were just strings, so I converted them to an array and parsed them into a float type.

Next, I created a loop in a loop and gradually added all possible pairs. 

I compared the result with the value of 2020, which was determined in the assignment.
